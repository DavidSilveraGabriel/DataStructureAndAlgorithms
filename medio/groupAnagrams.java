/*Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lower-case English letters.*/

/*Approach 1: Categorize by Sorted String
Intuition

Two strings are anagrams if and only if their sorted strings are equal.

Algorithm

Maintain a map ans : {String -> List} where each key \text{K}K is a sorted string, and each value is the list of strings from the initial input that when sorted, are equal to \text{K}K.

In Java, we will store the key as a string, eg. code. In Python, we will store the key as a hashable tuple, eg. ('c', 'o', 'd', 'e').*/
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        if (strs.length == 0) return new ArrayList();
        Map<String, List> ans = new HashMap<String, List>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] ca = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(ca);
            String key = String.valueOf(ca);
            if (!ans.containsKey(key)) ans.put(key, new ArrayList());
            ans.get(key).add(s);
        }
        return new ArrayList(ans.values());
    }

/*Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(NKlogK), where N is the length of strs, and K is the maximum length of a string in strs. The outer loop has complexity O(N) as we iterate through each string. Then, we sort each string in O(KlogK) time.

Space Complexity:O(NK), the total information content stored in ans.*/


//solution 2
/*Approach 2: Categorize by Count
Intuition

Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.

Algorithm

We can transform each string \text{s}s into a character count, \text{count}count, consisting of 26 non-negative integers representing the number of \text{a}a's, \text{b}b's, \text{c}c's, etc. We use these counts as the basis for our hash map.

In Java, the hashable representation of our count will be a string delimited with '#' characters. For example, abbccc will be #1#2#3#0#0#0...#0 where there are 26 entries total. In python, the representation will be a tuple of the counts. For example, abbccc will be (1, 2, 3, 0, 0, ..., 0), where again there are 26 entries total.
