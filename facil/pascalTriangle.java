/*Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.


In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]*/

/*Time complexity : O(numRows^2)

Although updating each value of triangle happens in constant time, it is
performed O(numRows^2) times. To see why, consider how many overall loop 
iterations there are. The outer loop obviously runs numRowsnumRows times, 
but for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs rowNumrowNum times. 
Therefore, the overall number of triangle updates that 
occur is numRows1+2+3+â€¦+numRows, which, according to Gauss' formula, is

Space complexity : O(numRows^2)
Because we need to store each number that we update in triangle,
 the space requirement is the same as the time complexity.*/
